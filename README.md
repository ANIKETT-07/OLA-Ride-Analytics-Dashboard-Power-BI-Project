# 5️⃣ Features / Highlights

---

## 🔹 Business Problem

Ride-hailing companies generate massive amounts of transactional data daily.

However, stakeholders often lack an intuitive way to quickly answer operational questions such as:

- How is ride demand changing over time?  
- What percentage of bookings are successfully completed?  
- Which vehicle types contribute the most ride distance?  
- Which payment methods drive the highest revenue?  
- What are the key reasons for cancellations?  
- Are driver and customer satisfaction levels stable?  

Raw booking tables do not provide clear, actionable insights without structured visualization.

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an interactive visual analytics tool that:

- Enables operational performance monitoring  
- Supports revenue and demand analysis  
- Identifies cancellation trends and service gaps  
- Highlights top-performing vehicle categories  
- Tracks customer and driver satisfaction  
- Supports strategic and operational decision-making
