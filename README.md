## 🔹 Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms generate thousands of daily transactions.  
However, stakeholders often struggle to answer:

- What is the ride demand trend?
- What percentage of rides are successful?
- Why are customers cancelling?
- Which vehicle types generate the most revenue?
- Which payment methods dominate?
- Are customer and driver ratings stable?

Raw data alone does not provide actionable insights.
